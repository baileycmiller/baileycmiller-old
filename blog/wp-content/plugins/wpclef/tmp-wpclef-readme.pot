msgid "Clef’s security architecture is fully distributed, which means Clef stores no user credentials on its servers. When you use the Clef mobile app, you create a profile and a private encryption key that never leave your phone. The Clef app then uses that data to generate a unique, encrypted digital signature every time you log in. Since all of your personal info stays on your phone, nothing in the Clef database can compromise your identity even in the unlikely event that the server is hacked."
