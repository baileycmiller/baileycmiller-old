        <h4>Overview</h4>
        <p>Leisure is a place for hobbies. It's designed to inspire its users to take advantage of their free time, learn new things, and find their passions. The iOS app has a database of hobbies for its users to explore, featuring descriptions, skill level information, and physical activity information. The app then lets its users collect their favorite hobbies for reference on the "My Hobbies" page. There's also a fun quiz feature that helps users find their potential calling.</p>
        <h4>Process</h4>

            <img id="floatleft" src="img/Projects/leisure2.png"/>
            <img id="floatleft" src="img/Projects/leisure1.png"/>
        </div>
        
        <p>This was the first complete, fully functional app I've ever made, so it has been an exciting experience. I started out with the need to find a way to organize and keep track of free time. As someone who has a large variety of hobbies, the inspiration came from a personal need to keep track of all the things I'm passionate about and ration my time equally between them all. Free time is a valuable resource that often leaves me wondering how to use it most effectively. So, I made this app to give users like myself the ability to grow and learn new things, as well as be inspired.</p><br>
        <p>In the beginning, the most challenging part was choosing a realistic and effective scope. I started out by clearly defining the features I wanted to tackle in the first version, making sure to set realistic goals. Next, I started making some simple mockups in Illustrator to get a sense of the user interface, colors, and typography that would fit the theme. Since this was my first app, I chose to build it through Cordova, which is a very handy program that takes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files and compiles them into fully functioning apps. The coding process was challenging, but it was quite rewarding to have a real app in the end.</p>
        <h4>Takeaways</h4>
        <p>The transition from mockup to code went smoother than I expected. I learned in this project that getting the mockup right before moving on to code helps make the coding go quicker and simpler with less hiccups. Although it sounds like the obvious thing to do, it's challenging for me because I often like to jump into code. I learned along the way that often times less is more, and that it's best to have quality over quantity when it comes to features. In future updates, I'd like to expand on Leisure's features and continue to add to the hobby database. I would like to include resources for each hobby so that those eager to get started can learn more. I'd hopefully like to implement ways that users can keep track of their hobbies and add goals as well.</p>
