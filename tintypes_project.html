        <h3>Tintypes</h3>

        Skills used: Wetplate Collodion Photography</i></p>

I spent much of the summer participating in an independent research project through the Undergraduate Summer Scholars program at Miami University in which I learned this unique, challenging, and rewarding process. The wet-plate collodion process was used predominantly in the late 19th-century to make what we call "tintypes." The process soon died off with the development of more modern photographic processes and film, but has experienced a recent rebirth among alternative process enthusiasts. What attracted me to this photographic form was not only the breathtaking images obtained from its result, but the process that requires you to slow down in a way that is completely opposite of the technological attitude of our modern day. I wanted to get back to the true meaning of photography. With the extreme technological shifts photography has taken recently, I wanted to experience photography as a true art formâ€” not as a digital file, but as something you take time to create.<br><br></p>

Learning an alternative process from 1890 was no easy task. The wet-plate collodion process is one that requires special care with the chemistry, camera, and steps involved. To educate myself on the process, I decided to attend a workshop on the making of tintypes by one of my main inspirations, Ian Ruhter. Ian Ruhter is a truly amazing artist who travels America making giant, spectacular tintypes using a camera that is actually a truck. At his workshop, we got to watch him work with his camera truck and then learn from him and make tintypes of our own. This workshop took place at the Palm Springs Photo Festival the April before my project started. This experience was nothing short of inspiring and awesome. I got to learn first hand from one of my favorite photographers and inspirations for wanting to learn the process, while meeting new unexpected friends along the way. By the time summer came around, I was ready to dive in and learn the process for myself.<br><br></p>
<p>                                   
I spent the months between the workshop and my summer project researching the needed chemistry, equipment, and all the things I was afraid would go wrong. I learned the many ways this process was difficult and frustrating along the way. Because it's quite an old process, doing it requires an old-style camera that is compatible with the 4x5in and 8x10in aluminum plates I was using to print the photos on. I used an 8x10 camera that was too heavy for me to carry in one piece. The other fun and frustrating part of the process was that you have to be in walking distance of a darkroom when photographing. The wet-plate collodion process is just as it sounds- the plate has to be wet. When you make a tintype, you must first coat the aluminum plate in collodion. Next, you have to sensitize this plate in silver nitrate before loading it in a film holder to put in the camera. Once you do this, you can then take the picture, being sure to quickly make your way back to the darkroom to develop, fix, and wash the plate before the chemistry dries. Although getting the hang of this unique system was often grueling and nerve-racking, seeing the one-of-a-kind photographs created from it were well worth the struggle. This project was more than research to me; it was a way to re-experience photography and get away from the ease and impatience of digital photography. I'm still pursuing the wet-plate collodion process and am learning so much from this complex, fascinating photographic process. </p>
