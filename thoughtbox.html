            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>Thoughtbox is an app that helps you free your mind. My idea for this iOS app was to create a simple but beautiful app that could serve as a visual tool to help users let go of unwanted thoughts. The main screen gives users a text box to enter in whatever they please. Then when the user hits 'done,' the thought disappears into an animated closing box. While not proven psychologically effective, it's more of an experiment in mental health management. I knew it was a simple idea, but wanted to see if there could be any ways that thoughts could be tamed through technology and design. It was created wholly in Swift for iOS.</p>
            <h4>Process</h4>
            <img id="floatright" src="img/animation.gif">
            <p>Once I had my idea locked in, I planned to go in a sleek, clean direction with the UI. I knew it was going to have only a few pages, so I needed the font, colors, and graphics to shine through the simplicity. I decided upon a teal gradient because it had a dreamy feeling to it, connecting to the thought theme. In Swift, the page sequencing and data entry wasn't too much of a challenge, so I tackled it first. Next came the bulk of the problem to solve in this project- figuring out how to cue an animation in Swift. When I first had my idea, I had in mind perhaps a GIF that would be created in Photoshop and placed in a UIImageView in Xcode easily. I soon found out, however, that Swift does not easily support GIF files and I would need to find a more creative way to include animation. My first sketch of the animation in GIF form looked like the GIF on the right.<br><br>
            Since this was my first time building a Swift app, this was a huge bear to tackle. I volleyed back and forth between methods, hitting dead ends many times. I finally figured out that the most practical way to do what I wanted would be to create hundreds of individual PNG files and load them in Swift individually, showing each of them in rapid succession. It was a difficult thing to figure out as a Swift newbie, but I finally made it work in the end. As a final result, users could then see the thought they entered pop up on the next screen and disappear into this magical box. This box would then close its folds and disappear as well, letting the thought go away forever. In the end I built a fun, straightforward, and quirky interactive tool that could hopefully cure unwanted thoughts.</p>
            <h4>Takeaways</h4>
            <p>This project was extremely challenging because I had little practice with Xcode prior to making this. I had used Cordova to make apps before, which was an entirely different process. I felt many limitations because of this, but I learned to work through all the error messages. Working in Xcode, you also wrestle with the challenges of designing for many different screens. In this app, I designed an iPad version as well as an iPhone version. It taught me the importance of being mindful of how different screens would experience my design and made me a more conscientious designer in the end.</p>
